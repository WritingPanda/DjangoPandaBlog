# A Simple Blog in Django

This blog was built following the **VERY** flawed tutorial by Arun Ravindran. You can find the tutorial [here](http://arunrocks.com/) if you're curious.

If you love Python and you want to develop on the web, I say go for it. The more you learn, the better developer you will be.
